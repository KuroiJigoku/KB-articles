## Short Answer

No. Free servers cannot be upgraded for free. The only way to get more resources, additional games, and a better server experience is by purchasing our [premium plan](falix/account/billing/purchasing-server).

## What Are My Options?

If you've outgrown your free server, purchasing a premium plan is the way to go. Premium gives you:

- **More RAM and CPU** to handle more players and heavier workloads
- **Access to more games and applications** beyond Minecraft and Hytale
- **More customization options** to configure your server however you like

> For a full walkthrough of the checkout process, see [How To Purchase a Premium Server](falix/account/billing/purchasing-server).

## How To Get Started

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).
2. Click [Create Server](https://client.falixnodes.net/create) in the navigation menu.
3. Select **Premium** as your server type.
4. Follow the checkout steps to choose your resources, billing cycle, and payment method.

Your new premium server will be ready to use as soon as payment is confirmed.
