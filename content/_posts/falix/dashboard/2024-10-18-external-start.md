The external start feature is a great way to allow players or users to start your server when needed without needing access to your server's console. This is especially handy when you want to let your community start the server on their own whenever they want to play.

## Toggling the External Start Feature

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Navigate to your [Profile Settings](https://client.falixnodes.net/profile/settings) by clicking "Settings" in the "Account" section of the navigation menu.

3. Look for the **External Server Start** toggle.

4. Flip the toggle to enable or disable the feature across all your servers. The change is saved automatically.

{: .info}
> This is an account-wide setting. When enabled, it applies to all servers you own.

## Starting a Server Using External Start

{: .warning}
> Server owners and admins are **not** allowed to use this feature, please use the console instead.

1. Go to the [External Start page](https://falixnodes.net/startserver).

2. Enter the subdomain of the server you want to start; it should resemble this format: `xxxxx.falixsrv.me`.

    > You can prefill the subdomain by adding `?ip=xxxxx.falixsrv.me` to the end of the page URL. Make sure to replace `xxxxx.falixsrv.me` with your actual subdomain.

3. Click on the "**Start Server**" button to initiate a server start.

{: .success}
> If successful, you should see "Server `xxxxx.falixsrv.me` has been started".

> You may have to wait a few minutes for the server to finish starting.

## Offline MOTD

While your server is offline, its MOTD (Message of the Day) is automatically replaced with a message that looks like this:

> This server is OFFLINE!
> Start the server at FalixNodes.net/start

This lets anyone who pings your server in their server list know that it can be started remotely. The offline MOTD is always shown while the server is off — disabling the external start feature will not remove it. Once your server starts up, the MOTD returns to whatever you have set in your server properties.
